# XML Parser Upload

## Purpose

This HTML file provides a simple web-based interface for uploading and parsing XML files. Its main purposes are:

1. **XML File Upload**: Allow users to select and upload XML files from their local machine.

2. **XML Parsing**: Parse the uploaded XML file and display its contents in a structured format.

3. **User-Friendly Interface**: Provide a clean and intuitive interface using Bootstrap for styling.

4. **Clear Functionality**: Allow users to clear the uploaded file and parsed results to start over.

## Key Features

- **File Selection**: Users can select XML files using a file input field.
- **Parse Button**: Initiates the parsing process for the selected XML file.
- **Clear Button**: Allows users to reset the file input and clear parsed results.
- **Result Display**: Shows the parsed XML content in a structured list format.
- **Error Handling**: Alerts users if they try to parse without selecting a file.

## How It Works

1. The user selects an XML file using the file input.
2. When the "Parse XML" button is clicked, the file is read and parsed using JavaScript.
3. The parsed content is displayed on the page, showing each element's tag name and text content.
4. Users can clear the input and results at any time using the "Clear" button.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- Bootstrap 5.3.0-alpha1 (for styling)

## Potential Use Cases

- Quick inspection of XML file contents
- Debugging XML structures
- Educational tool for learning about XML parsing
- Starting point for more complex XML processing applications

This tool provides a simple, browser-based solution for viewing the structure and content of XML files without the need for specialized software.
